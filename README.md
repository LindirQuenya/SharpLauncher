# SharpLauncher for BlueMaxima's Flashpoint
SharpLauncher is an alternative launcher for <a href="https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/">BlueMaxima's Flashpoint</a>, a webgame preservation project. It is written in C# (utilizing Windows Forms for its GUI), and serves as a frontend for the <a href="https://github.com/oblivioncth/CLIFp">CLIFp</a> command-line tool.

Despite offering full access to the Flashpoint archive, SharpLauncher is a work-in-progress and does not provide the same level of functionality as the Electron launcher (and likely never will).

## Prerequisites
* <a href="https://github.com/oblivioncth/CLIFp">CLIFp</a> (ideal location is a `CLIFp` folder within the Flashpoint directory)
* <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/496132309498724391/945863222991392798/filters.json">filters.json</a> (if you want extreme entries to be filtered; must be placed in the same directory as SharpLauncher)
